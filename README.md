# 🧠 Battle of Logic

Battle of Logic is a simple yet engaging quiz-based game built with Python and Tkinter. Players face off against an enemy by answering logic and math questions. Correct answers deal damage to the enemy, while wrong answers reduce the player's health. The game continues until either the player or the enemy runs out of health.
